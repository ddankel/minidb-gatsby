This is one of the miniatures from the Ral Partha High Elf Irregular blister I picked up in a bargain bin at my local gaming ship. It's one of the apparently few miniatures that I didn't either paint up for a miniature game or for specific use in a role-playing game - I just really liked the sculpt.
