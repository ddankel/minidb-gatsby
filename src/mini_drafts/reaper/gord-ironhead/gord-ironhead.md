Gord was originally purchased to serve as the captain of a friend's Mordheim squad, and remained unpainted for years even after it was given to me when its owner quit playing. I eventually decided to go ahead and give him a really fast paint job just so I'd have another dwarf painted and ready for use.

Ole' Gordy's definitely not going to win any awards, but he looks good enough at 3-4 feet and that's what's necessary for tabletop use.
