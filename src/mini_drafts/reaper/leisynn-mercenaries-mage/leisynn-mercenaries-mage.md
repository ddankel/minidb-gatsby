## Blog Post

Leisynn probably lived on my painting desk in various stages of completion for close to a couple of years.  I started and stopped him a number of times as I picked up other projects until I decided to finally buckle down and finish him up.

Although it didn't photograph well I was pretty happy with Leisynn's robes.  They're painted with P3 Coal Black as a primary color, highlighted with a dark teal.  I really liked the color and if I ever finish my painter's version of the Great American Novel I'll be using it heavily there.
