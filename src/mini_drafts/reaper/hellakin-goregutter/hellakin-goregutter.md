## Blog Post
I leaned pretty hard on the thief aesthetic when painting Hellakin, going with dark colors all around.  I used a purple similar to my Protectorate forces for the cloak.  I was pretty happy with the dark look next to the black armor but in retrospect I wish I would have gone with a more intense purple.

Cloak:

- DC Royal Plum
- Shaded Black and highlighted AB Medium Flesh.
- Should have used more traditional purple upon reflection
