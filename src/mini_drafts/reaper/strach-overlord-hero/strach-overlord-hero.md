Comparing Strach here to the original sculpt I made a few minor changes.  The original sword was damaged pretty much beyond repair, and my attempts at straightening it weakened the blade to the point I decided to replace it completely.

I also did a few quick alterations to his right arm, replacing the spell effect with the hand of another miniature in a beckoning gesture.  Finally the skulls were filed off his cuffs for a little less gothic look.
