There's not a lot to say about this older model I painted what now seems like ages ago. He's another one of the rather 2-dimensional Chainmail sculpts that lack much depth. I mostly drybrushed the black areas but the green sash on this figure was one of my first ever attempts at highlighting via layering.

The hair was another experiment on my part. I initially painted it black and highlighted it with drybrushing up almost to white. After that I stained the entire thing with a mix of the old GW Flesh Wash and brown paint to create a reddish-brown hair color. Later refined the technique a bit to use it elsewhere in my collection.

This was another model from the era of craft paint metallics and it really shows on the sword blades.
