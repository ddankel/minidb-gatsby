As [Privateer Press Weekend at DieCon 8](http://www.dankelzahn.com/blog/2008/06/24/dieconprivateer-press-weekend-wrap-up/) was being planned, the organizers approached some of the local painters with an idea to give away models as door prizes and as an overall prize over the weekend. I had enough on my plate that I had to finish before DieCon that I couldn't do too many figures, but I did agree to paint Broadsides Bart here.

In order to have the army that was being given away look coherent, another local was building and painting all of the bases. He did the deck work and painting on the base seen here.
