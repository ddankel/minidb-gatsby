I painted Morvahna up to give away to a local circle player a few years ago. I spent most of the time working on the wet blends on her cloak - everything else seemed to come together quickly. Morvahna's flesh was done in all P3 paints in an effort to experiment & practice using them and I'm happy with how they came out. They're smoother than some of the other female skin tones I've done before.

The only other painting of note is the filigree on her armor. Most of the PP studio Circle models have a gold/brass armor with green fill between the filigree. I didn't own any green ink, so I experimented with blue ink and thinned yellow paint and got some great results. I washed that over a base coat of P3 Brass Balls and then after some post-ink re-highlights the armor was done.
