Although it was done up specifically to give away, I enjoyed painting the Fell Caller. The vast amount of detail on the model was a double-edged sword - it was fun to paint but also tedious at times. This was also my first time trying a freehand tartan pattern, and although it came out ok there are a few things I'd do differently next time.

Normally the torch on this model ends with an opening up top, but the model's owner wanted me to take the fire cone that came with his Pyre Troll for use as a breath weapon and use it here so I pinned it on up top. Considering how bad it looks on the Pyre Troll I think the owner made a good choice.
