Epic Lylyth - just like regular Lylyth but with more Lylyth.

That's a pretty fair statement, but there are some differences between the two models. First off I went away from the bone armor that I had used on the original Lylyth. It looked ok on the model but I wound up not carrying it through on the rest of the faction so switched back to metallic armor on Epic Lylyth.

The spines poking out of here hair were a nice touch on the model and the feathers are sculpted much better than they were on the original model as well. Otherwise she's very similar to her non-epic self. Blue cloak, bone and metal bow, and a visored face.
