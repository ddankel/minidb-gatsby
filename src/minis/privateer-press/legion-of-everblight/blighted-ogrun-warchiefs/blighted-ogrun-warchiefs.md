Enough time had past since I painted my initial Warmongers that I was worried about being able to match their skin tones, but the War Chiefs turned out pretty close when I was done with them. That's one of the biggest hurdle I've come cross as my Legion army grows - matching blends I did on previous models.

The second model here is the stock pose of the Warmonger War Chief. It's not bad but the way the weapon hangs out over the base can make it difficult to maneuver around other models, especially under Rhyas' feat. The first pose was my solution - by propping up the model's front foot on some rock I was able to lower the polearm to a more vertical position and minimized base overhang and make the model easier to use on the tabletop.
