I'm not as big of a fan of the Saeryn sculpt as I am of her sister Rhyas, but she's not too bad. Her daggers aren't that great and the sculpt is rather flat, though. PP seems to be going that way with a lot of their smaller models to save on production costs.

Blues, grays, silver, and black. Yup, another standard Nyss color scheme for me.
