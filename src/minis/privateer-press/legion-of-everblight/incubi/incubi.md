Painting Incubii introduced a challenge I hadn't experienced yet on any of my Legion models. I had established very similar but distinct skintones for my Nyss and warbeast models, and the Incubii had both stretched over each other across the figure. That meant maintaining the preexisting schemes without the areas just looking like half were mis-painted.

When I first started my Incubi, I had intended to paint them as bloody messes like the Privateer studio scheme, but when I finished the two layers of skin I changed my mind. As it was, it reminded me of the "[Edgar Suit](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELDSYX6_uZU&feature=related)" - the nickname for Vincent D'Onofrio's character in the first Men in Black movie. So instead of the bloody mess, I left it to look like the skin was just being shed off the Incubi as they were emerging.
