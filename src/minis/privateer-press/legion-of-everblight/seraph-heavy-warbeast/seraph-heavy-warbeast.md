### Seraph 1

This seraph was the first non-battlebox beast that I painted. I wanted to get it on the table and use it but I didn't want to affix it to the base before I painted it queued up next out of necessity. The Seraph is painted just like the rest of my beasts with the exception of the wings, which didn't have any precedent yet. I wound up going with a darker blue, similar to the color I used for the nyss' leather.

### Seraph 2

Although I like the new bend in the wings I gave my second seraph, quality wise I don't think the paint job lives up to his older brother. I was trying to add some more definition to the musculature and the end result looks more unpolished than anything else.
