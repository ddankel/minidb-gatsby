I knew how I wanted to paint my Warmongers for quite some time, I just had so many other models I wanted to paint that they fell by the wayside. When I finally got to them I took my blighted Nyss skin recipe and replaced the Sky Blue with Quaker Gray. The resulting color was very similar but was a more muted blue.

I really liked the way the Warmongers turned out. The sculpts are great and I was happy with how the musculature took my paint style. Even all the leather straps and chainmail came together quickly for these guys.
