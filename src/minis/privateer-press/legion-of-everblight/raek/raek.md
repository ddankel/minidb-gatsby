I wish that the Raek was as good in-game as it was as a model. I love this sleek, bitey little guy but I don't see him hitting the table very often. He receieved a much-needed boost in Mk II but I always seemed to spend his points on other options.

Effectiveness aside I like the Raek model a lot. I used the sculpt to try and work on duplicating the musculature effects I achieved on the Nephilim Soldier, including some slight striations on some of the more pronounced muscles.
