Just like most of the other Legion models, Hordes fans either love the Terpah or they hate it. I tend to fall on the positive side myself. There's something about the sleek draconic look that I find visually appealing.

Like the Carnivean, the Teraph was cursed with unsightly footpads cast beneath its talons. It took some work with an exacto knife and a jeweler's saw to remove the excess material but I think the result was worth the extra work. The pads on the feet of the [stock model](http://privateerpress.com/hordes/gallery/legion-of-everblight/warbeasts/teraph) as displayed on Privateer's site are really ugly.
