Apparently Everblight developed a fondness for bellbottoms some time during Hordes: Evolution and the Shepherds sure do emphasize that. Other than the cutting and reposing of one of the Shepherd's left arm there's very little special about these two -- my typical Nyss colors on average Nyss sculpts.
