The Deliverers were one of the units I picked up and painted early on, but I only ever bought 6. I didn't see the need to play more than that in Mk I, and in Mk II I usually fielded other units anyway.

For the most part they were done just like my Zealots - tan overcoats with royal purple highlights. Add in the darker brown leathers and the end result is a unit that looks significantly less regal on the table than the "elite" Protectorate models - Exemplar and 'casters - which was my goal.
