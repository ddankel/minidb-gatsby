This Repenter was a lot of firsts for me. It was my first warmachine miniature, and actually my first time doing anything with a more "industrial" feel to it. It was also the first time I had to come up with a color scheme for an entire army, not just a single miniature.

I chose to try a less subtle, more razor-highlighting style on the reddish purple. The result was so-so... a few areas weren't near as crisp as I has intended, but since this was a gaming piece I didn't want to spend days redoing each area. I really wanted to just get my battlebox painted and on the table as fast as possible. The beige was highlighted in a more subtle style, and I think turned out better than the reddish purple.

While this figure didn't turn out at display quality, I did learn a lot of lessons from it and each 'jack I've painted since has gotten progressively better. All in all it was a sufficient starting point.
