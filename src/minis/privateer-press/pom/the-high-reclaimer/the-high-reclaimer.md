## Blog Post

Despite my desire to keep away from traditionally "evil" color schemes for my Protectorate forces, I decided to go dark on the High Reclaimer. His fluff depicts him as clad in black, so I went with black and silver armor instead of white and gold. I also kept his robes a shade darker than what I normally do, continuing the theme.

The flame effect on his weapon was inspired by its in game fire-causing effect. It was a first attempts and I think it turned out unbalanced. I should have carried the effect further down the blades of the weapon. I'll get another chance when I do the epic version of this warcaster.
