I don't want to think about how long it took me to paint my character jacks, but they're finally done and ready for the tabletop. Unfortunately Blessing lost a few of his cooler abilities in MkII, but he's still a solid jack with Severius.

This model came in more pieces than the other Protectorate lights. While that meant more customizability it also meant more tedious work. In the end I went with the current pose to try and minimize the amount of space he'd take on the tray, but now I regret it. I wish I would have shortened the spear shaft a bit and gone with a more vertical pose, but it's too late now.
