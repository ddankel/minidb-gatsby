## Blog Post

Feora was the second warcaster model I painted after Kreoss and I think a bit of a step backwards for me. Maybe I was rushing too quickly or maybe it was just all of the mechanics (which I seem to struggle with) but compared to most of my other work Feora unfortunately just doesn't quite match up. Which is a shame since she won me the first tournament I ever attended back in '06.

I had dreams of converting Feora's right wrist-mounted flamethrower to be spouting a gout of flame into the air, but I realized that the time and effort to do them combined with my meager abilities in sculpting flame would result in the whole effect turning out gaudy and poorly done so I scrapped it early on.
