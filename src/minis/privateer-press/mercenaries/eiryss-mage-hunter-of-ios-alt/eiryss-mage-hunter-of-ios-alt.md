This alternate sculpt of Eiryss, Mage-Hunter of Ios was available as a giveaway to people who sent the redemption form in a few issues of No Quarter magazine in to Privateer Press. Although I much prefer the dynamic nature of the original pose this one is definitely a higher quality sculpt overall.

I painted most of Eiryss while I was working on other products, and used some of the recipes for browns that I developed on my Idrians on her armor. Her cloak was my experimenting with the Privateer Press Paint color Coal Black. Shaded with a little black and highlighted with white, I was able to come up with what I feel is a pretty striking color relatively quickly.
