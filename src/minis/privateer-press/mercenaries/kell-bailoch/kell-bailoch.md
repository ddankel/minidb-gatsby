Kell was painted up pretty quickly in a color scheme that would fairly label him a Browncoat. I can't say it's my best work but I'm more than a little unhappy with how it photographed. Results like this are making me seriously consider revamping my photography set-up again.

The coat is a mix of P3 Idrian Flesh and some RMS Driftwood Brown. I used the same Driftwood Brown on his pants but the shadows are obscuring them. The sword scabbard was my first experiment highlighting black with P3 Coal Black - it doesn't look too bad but I need more practice.
