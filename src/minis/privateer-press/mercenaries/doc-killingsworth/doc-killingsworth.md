Doc is a fun character in the Iron Kindgoms/Warmachine world. Serving as both ship's cook and surgeon, his stew was suspect and his presence made sailors fight beyond normally crippling injuries since they rather face an opponent injured than be subjected to "surgery."

I painted up two versions of this miniature at once, the second with a bloody smock that was for a friend. I wanted a cleaner look for mine though.
