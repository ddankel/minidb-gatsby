Sometimes I think I go too far with muted color schemes. I always prefer them for something like Anastasia here instead of painting the spy in bright and garish colors but it doesn't translate to the table top nearly well.

The sculpt wasn't my favorite by far and I probably wouldn't have painted Anastasia if I didn't want to use her in my army and I think that made me rush her. She's just so... plain. Fits for a spy but it could have used a splash of color for the tabletop.
