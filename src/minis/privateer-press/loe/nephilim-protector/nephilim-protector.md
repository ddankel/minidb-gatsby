I really like the aesthetics of the Legion Nephilim warbeasts and the Protector is no exception. The large expanses of armor were a bit daunting at first but I wound up giving them a similar treatment as my Warmongers, but instead of the flat black inner armor I went with a very dark metallic. I think the result looks great on this sculpt.

Unfortunately the snow on this miniature's base has yellowed a bit after about six years or so. It's disappointing to see and I may have to re-base the figure at some point in the future.
