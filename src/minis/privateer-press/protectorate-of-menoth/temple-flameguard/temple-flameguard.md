I painted the Temple Flameguard up during a business trip in 2006, back when taking fluids on an airplane wasn't restricted. They were done with what is at this point my standard Menite process. They flew home with me just a little short of complete but I finished the shields and spears and attached them all soon afterwards.

In 2007 I added the Temple Flameguard Preceptor and Standard Bearer to the unit. These two models were painted useing the same techniques as the original members of the unit, but my skill had improved a lot. Even though I painted them quicker than their earlier bretheren they turned out better on the whole. Signs of improvement like this can really help motivate you to keep painting.
