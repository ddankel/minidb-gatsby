The Daughters of the Flame, aka Menoth's Angels, were a relatively dainty unit to paint compared to the bulky knights and spearmen that are more common in the Protectorate army. But they fit together well and once I got them on my painting desk it I was able to work through them relatively easily.

I decided to use my Reaper colors on the purple cloth areas on all of these miniatures to see how they looked next to units like my Temple Flameguard who were done in the Delta Ceramcoat line. They matched up well enough Idecided to switch to the Reaper paints as my primary ones for this color. If only I could find a version of Goosefeather in one of the good paint ranges...
