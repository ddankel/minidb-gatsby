The Paladin of the Order of the Wall was too interesting a sculpt to pass up, even if it's not quite as useful in-game as some of my other options. It was fun to paint up and looks great on the table. It's also recently been used as a battle-chaplain of Morrow in the Witchfire Trilogy. Sweet, sweet irony.

The Paladin to the left was my original Paladin, purchased pretty early on as a points filler. I added the right paladin after Vilmon was released so I could run the three musketeers around the table top, hacking down waracks in Menoth's name. It was done at basically a speed paint pace but still turned out better than the original.
