High Exmplar Gravus has some pretty nice [concept art](http://cwalton73.deviantart.com/art/High-Exemplar-Gravus-82207216) but I always felt the mounted sculpt was a little... stumbly? Despite that I do like the sculpts. There's a good amount of detail on the armor - slightly more than the standard exemplar model - but not too much so.

This and the Vengers' are the only horses I've painted so far so I'm still trying to perfect that. It's proving about as difficult as human(oid) skin tones.
