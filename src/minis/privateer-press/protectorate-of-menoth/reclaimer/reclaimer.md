The Reclaimer was actually a pretty quick figure to paint considering a vast majority of it was either black or metallic and there was very little exposed flesh. Still black can be a tricky color to paint. I went ahead and went the wet blending route since every time I try to layer black it seems to turn out poorly. The result is subtle but present, which was what I was going for so I'm happy with it. On the down side the highlighting on the teal trim of the stole doesn't show up well, which is dissapointing.
