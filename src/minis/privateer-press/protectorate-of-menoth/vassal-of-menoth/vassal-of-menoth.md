The Vassal of Menoth isn't one of the more exciting sculpts Privateer Press has released. Then again, they're infinitely useful on the tabletop so maybe there's some sort of inverse correlation there.

There's just enough detail on the Vassal to give a painter options to integrate it into their army's color scheme. I opted for a pretty basic approach myself.
