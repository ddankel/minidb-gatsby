Severius was the first of my Protectorate pieces where I broke down and decided to try some actual miniature paint as opposed to the craft paint I had been using up to that point. I took my Delta Ceramcoat Royal Plum out to the game store and compared it to the Reaper Master Series paints they had to find a match. I wound up finding a color called Dusky Grape that was remarkable similar so I picked it up.

In my haste to try out the paint I used a slightly different highlight color on my purples. Because of that the highlights look more white and less pinkish like the rest of my Protectorate models. I decided I liked the different look on Severius and kept it how it was, but it took a few models to refine my highlighting scheme after that.
