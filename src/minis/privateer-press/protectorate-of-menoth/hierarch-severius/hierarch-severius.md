Much like the Harbinger of Menoth, I wasn't a big fan of the extra people on the stock version of this model's base. The Hierarch standing on the backs of a couple zealots might be fluffy, but it's not what I wanted to put on the table. Instead I decided to model my conversion after Severius' encounter with Vlad in Warmachine: Legends. I build a large rock outrcopping for Severius to stand on out of cork, and fashoned a small book stand out of foam and cardstock to hold the Covenant of Menoth (bits ordered separately).

I'm pretty happy with the results overall. Bits prices are a little high and the conversion was more costly than I would have liked but I really wanted something different for my version of the Hierarch and I think it paid off.
