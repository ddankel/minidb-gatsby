I painted the Hierophant in time for DieCon X back in 2010. I'm pretty happy with how it turned out.

I think I've already made my biggest critique of this figure in a previous WIP post about it.

> Working all the metallics reminded me how much I hate painting them. I always look at each miniature as I paint it and think "I'll just bother learning how to paint metallics on the next figure" and rush through it, but I always put it off to the proverbial next time.
