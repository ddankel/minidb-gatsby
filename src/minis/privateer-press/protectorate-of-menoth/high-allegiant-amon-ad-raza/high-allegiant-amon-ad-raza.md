Considering the most flesh that's visible on a Protectorate of Menoth miniature is maybe a hand or two and how long it's been since I painted anything else, it took more effort than usual to do Amon's bare chest. I actually had just finished Amon when I took this photograph and hadn't sealed him yet. As a result, the miniature seems a bit glossy - I use watered down Future Floor Finish to thin my paints and a byproduct is the reflective sheen which can obscure some of the highlights from the camera.

I actually lost inspiration on this miniature after I finished up the flesh portions. I just couldn't decide how to paint it up. Eventually I settled on what you see above, which is meant to be reminiscent of my warjacks (dark armored plates over the white/tan hull plates) since Amon is a warjack-centric warcaster.
