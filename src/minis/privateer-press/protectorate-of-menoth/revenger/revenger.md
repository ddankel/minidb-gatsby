### First Mini

I started this Revenger soon after the Repenter was completed. I decided to switch up the color scheme across the upper body of the miniature for a bit of variety, and it turned out fairly well. Taking what I had learned from the Repenter, I decided on a more subtle highlighting on the 'hood' and shoulder pieces on this figure. Unfortunately most of the highlighting wound up being washed out during photographing the mini.

This was also the first use of the blue color my fiancée mixed up for me to use as an accent color on some of my figures. I repeated its use on the Crusader and Kreoss as well. There wasn't much highlighting to do since the warjack's body shades it, but it was good to see it on a miniature next to the reddish purple and beige.

### Second Mini

This miniature sat unpainted in my army transport case for some time - I already had one painted Revenger and I didn't field two often enough to need to get it down. Once I got closer to caught up on my Protectorate forces I decided to go ahead and paint it up.

Looking at this and at my first Revenger - painted roughly a year and a half earlier - I can see a high difference in quality. I wouldn't say I've become that much of a better painter, but I'm far more familiar with how to paint a warjack now. I've also been able to pick up a few tricks and techniques to paint the constructs more efficiently.

Color-wise I decided to switch up the colors on the upper chassis to match my Repenter. It makes my Revengers similar enough in appearance to look like they're part of the same force while still letting tell them apart quickly without having to number their bases.
