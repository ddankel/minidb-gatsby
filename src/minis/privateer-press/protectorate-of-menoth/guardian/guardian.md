The Guardian was one of those models that say unassembled on my desk for so long that I wanted to get it finished just to have it finished. I'm not a fan of back-banners of any type in Warmachine or Hordes so I left them off, which had the side effect of making him far more practical to store in an army transport tray.

Unfortunately the Guardian never saw much table time. Other than pulling double duty as a heavy and an arc node for Mk I eFeora he doesn't leave his transport tray. Now in MkII he's even lost his job working for eFeora and is just outright outclassed by other Protectorate choices.
