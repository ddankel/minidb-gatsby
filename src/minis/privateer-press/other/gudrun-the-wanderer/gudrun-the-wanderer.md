I painted Gudrun towards the end of 2008 as a diversion from the Legion models I had been rapidly turning out. His color scheme was primarily chosen to let me test out P3's Ordic Olive color, which I used on his cowl.

The fleshtones are my Vallejo Model Color Rose Brown/Medium Skintone/Sunny Skintone combination that I use for a less pink tone. I usually mix just a bit of a medium flesh color in to add a hint of pinkness to the skin but for the Orgun - a relatively monstrous race in the Iron Kingdoms - I went with the stock colors listed above, which results in a slightly more yellow tint.
