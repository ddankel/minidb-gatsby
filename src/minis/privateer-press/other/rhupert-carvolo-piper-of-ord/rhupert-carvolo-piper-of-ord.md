## Blog Post

After an one-armed, no-handed Piper lead my troops to victory enough times I decided it was time to reward the faithful musician with an assembly and paint job. My first instinct was to paint him in a similar color to my Menite army, but I decided to go with something completely different instead - if I don't paint something non-Menite every once in a while I tend to burn out.

I used the Piper to experiment with muted colors a bit, mixing a gray in with my greens and blues for the jacket and trousers. I think the end result turned out well. It definitely would have looked more garish if I hadn't muted the colors as much.
