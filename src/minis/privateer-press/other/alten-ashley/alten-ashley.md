Even though I only really use Alten with my Protectorate forces for mixed games, and even then almost primarily in Mk I, I really like the model and wanted to get it painted. He really captures the 'dirty old hunter' look and the bell-shaped riffle barrel is a nice touch.

In addition to trying out the P3 flesh wash on Alten's skin, I experimented with mixing P3 and RMS paints with my craft paints to see how they did. As expected the model paints with their higher concentration of pigment dominated when mixing but it was easy to account for on the fly.
