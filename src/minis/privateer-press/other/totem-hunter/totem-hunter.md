## Blog Post

Despite how much I disliked the stock pose on this miniature I wasn't willing to spend the time required to do a complete re-pose on a figure I wasn't expecting to field too often to begin with. So I decided to work with the stock pose as best I could.

The flesh tones were done by starting with an olive color that I mixed with some gray to make it a more neutral tone. I shaded with a brown wash and started highlighting by mixing a lighter gray into the base color and layering up from there. Once that was done I added the brown specks to the forehead and washed over it with the olive color to blend it back into the flesh color.

The dark armor plates were my first experiment with really highlighting black with blue. I think I might have gone to far and the blue has become the dominant color, but I think the over all effect turned out well.
