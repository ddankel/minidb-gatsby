Although my first try at painting a light source, I was rather pleased with how Gorman turned out. All of his garments were painted in various browns to create a dull, utilitarian look. This was meant to contrast the glowing vials hanging from his waist. I think the end result really highlights the vials.

The glow itself was done by blending the bright green into a mix of that green and the color of whatever it was on top of. So for the front of the tabard I mixed that brown with the green and blended that up to pure green at the edge. It was a somewhat simple process from a technical standpoint but took forever as I tried to make the glow look right.
