Yup, yet another gaming miniature. This one was painted up to represent an elven ranger-turned-arcane archer in a old D&D 3.5 game. Traditionally I'm not a fan of the system, but a friend came up with a campaign world I liked that he wanted to run d20 in so I went along with it.

This figure was one of my earlier attempts at layered blending. Despite part of it being painted at 3:00am one night while I was sitting at an old computer operations job waiting for processes to run and doing nothing, I was happy with the way it turned out.
