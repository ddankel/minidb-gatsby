The Dark Elf Black Guard were originally used to represent Fell Blades in my old Dark Elf Mordheim warband. As some of my earliest pieces, they really show my "basecoat, wash, drybush" techinques of the time. As unimpressive as they are now putting together a cohesive looking force was an accomplishment for me back then.

It took me a while to come up with the color scheme for my warband but I eventually settled on the blue and black that you see here - I was having success painting blues and the black seemed to help make the army suitbly dark. These two models are actually the two different Dark Elf Black guard unit leader sculpts that I bits-ordered from GW (along with the swords).
