I originally painted up this figure to use in my Dark Elf Mordheim warband. I was really excited to be able to do him in the black scheme I had in mind; basecoat black, drybrush, and I'd be done! 🙂 The assassin's not perfect, but he was one of my favorite pieces in my collection at the time.

I still remember how happy I was with how the wrap-bracers turned out. It was a revelation at the time to just hit them with a wash of black after all the highlighting was done, but when you're teaching yourself how to paint these little revelations that later seem obvious are how you improve your technique.
