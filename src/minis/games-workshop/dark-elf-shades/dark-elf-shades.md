The Dark Elf Shades were originally used to represent heroes in my old Dark Elf Mordheim warband. As some of my earliest pieces, they really show my "basecoat, wash, drybush" techniques of the time. They're remarkably unimpressive compared to my current paint jobs but putting together a cohesive looking force was an accomplishment for me back then. It took me a while to come up with the color scheme for my warband but I eventually settled on the blue and black that you see here - I was having success painting blues and the black seemed to help make the army suitably dark.

I really liked the shade models - they have some nice details like the ornamental hooks and pouches but not too much. I enjoyed deploying them into ye' ole' ruined city back in college.
