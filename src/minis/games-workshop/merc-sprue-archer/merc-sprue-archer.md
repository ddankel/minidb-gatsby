This miniature was assembled from various pieces of the Games Workshop Mordheim Mercenary plastic sprue. The face seems to have turned out well but the miniature is hardly perfect. It's difficult to see the black picking on the fletching from this angle, but it's there. The leather vest is obscured by shadows caused by my lighting - I wasn't able to fix that while photographing the miniature.

Djavvah here is from a gypsy-ish background, hence the rather gaudy colors. Yellow has always proved almost as difficult to paint as red for me, and as a result I haven't practiced near enough to be good at it yet.
