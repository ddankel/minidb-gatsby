## Blog Post

I painted up this Reaper of Alahan (one of three in the blister) for a character to use as his arcane engineer in a Children of the Sun campaign. The hardest part was the white legging and gloves - white has always been a tricky color to shade. The sword pommel could use a little brightening up, though.

The leather and blues were all done in the usual basecoat with shadow, layer up to highlight technique I used with my Appelbarrel paints at the time. I was tempted to go for NMM on the blade and gun barrel, but as bad at NMM as I was (and still am), I think the metallics were a better choice.
