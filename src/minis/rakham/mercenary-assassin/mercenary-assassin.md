I picked this figure up a while ago and was holding on to him until I got inspired enough to paint him. When I dug him up while searching through my bare pewter collection for a good figure for a rogue/assassin character I figured it was as good of a time as any.

I really wanted this figure to have an overall shadowy feel to him, hence the various grays that were used as the primary colors. Even the browns for the leather were done in a muted tone so as to not stand out. I realized that I needed something to make him pop though, so painted the cloth mask bright red as an accent.
