"Mira" was as originally a Ral Partha elf that came in a blister with four others labeled as High Elf Irregular Officers. I had purchased the blister specifically for one of the other miniatures in it, but my wife picked this one out to serve as the base for her first RPG character.

I removed the model's head with an exacto knife and filed down as much as possible. The feline head was donated by a Panthera Spearman from the 100 Kingdoms line. I'm not a fan of most of the 100 Kingdoms sculptures but picked up a few Panthera specifically for this purpose at GenCon one year. Unfortunately the original elf head had long hair and my sculpting skills were non-existent at the time so I cheated by shaping a hood (read: hood-shaped blob) over the elf's hair. The original small, thin sword was replaced with a larger one made from the spearhead from a Games Workshop Dark Elf Warrior sprue.
