The Troll Sky Raider is one of my favorite miniatures from the old Heartbreaker Hobbies Earthdawn line. Not because of some exceptional quality of sculpt. To be frank, it's lacking in a number of aspects. But in my mind sky raiders are one of the iconic visuals of the Earthdawn setting.

The living crystal, especially the shoulder pad, stands out a bit more in person - the reflected light on the photograph is in part because they were given a gloss coating after the rest of the figure was sealed. I was temped to go with Ago-Frod at first, but liked the warm feeling the Ago-Chad crystals gave. Plus next to the contrasting olive jerkin it stands out more.
