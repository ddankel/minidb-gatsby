I leaned pretty hard on the thief aesthetic when painting Hellakin, going with dark colors all around. I used a purple similar to my Protectorate forces for the cloak. I was pretty happy with the dark look next to the black armor but in retrospect I wish I would have gone with a more intense purple.
