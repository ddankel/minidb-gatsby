This is another miniature painted up for an Earthdawn game and was used as an Obsidiman Wizard until the player decided he wanted to play something else. This one is a Reaper fig that is larger than standard 25mm figures.

I did a better job highlighting the stone before I speckled it than I did with my first Chainmail Stonechild, so the cracks and crags stand out much better on this one. You can see a lot of imperfections sculpted on the leather skirt. This figure's supposed to be completely stone, but I wanted an obdidiman instead of a golem so I painted it as aged leather instead.
