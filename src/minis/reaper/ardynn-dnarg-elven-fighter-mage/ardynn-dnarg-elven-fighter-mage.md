Ardynn is yet another miniature inspired by a character in my Earthdawn campaign- this time an NPC Warrior/Nethermancer. I wanted to stay away from the stereotypical "necromancer black" though so decided to use a few different blues as the miniature's primary color.

It was hard coming up with a color scheme that said leaned toward darker tones but didn't scream "Evil wizard!" but I think there's enough color in there to brighten it. I did go with black for his weapon sheathes, giving them a gloss overcoat after sealing for a lacquered look. The royal purple tunic was my wife's idea and gives enough contrast to keep the figure from turning into a grayish-bluish blob on the gaming table.
