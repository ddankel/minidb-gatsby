My wife picked this miniature out to represent her Earthdawn character - a Dinganni Warrior. The Dinganni are a darker skinned people, so the skintone on this one is a little darker than what I usually do.

The miniature was mostly metallics, so wasn't too hard to complete. The sword was an attempt to give the appearance of cracked ice on the gaming table. It's a little abrupt this close up, but it looks good at the 3-4 foot range. The armor was done in Boltgun Metal + Black to darken with Tin Bitz + Shining Gold trim. The hilt of the sword is Shining Gold.
