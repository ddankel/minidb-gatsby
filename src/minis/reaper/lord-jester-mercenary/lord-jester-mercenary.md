I was particularly happy with how Lord Jester turned out. Faces are always hard and this is one of my better products. Likewise the bright teal jacket turned out to pop sufficiently. The end result is one of my favorite recent pieces.

The base is mostly my usual dirt and grass combo but I found a few smaller sticks in my back yard I wanted to purpose for basing. I set them out to dry for a few days at room temperature then used an oven set at 100Â°F for a couple of hours for good measure.
