The Black Legionnaire is actually a repaint. It was originally one of my first paint jobs and while functional I wanted another shot at the sculpt. After a Pinesol soak and scrubbing I forced myself out of my muted-color-safe-zone.

I went with the vibrant - stark red and white - and tried to make sure the shading was deep enough to make the colors pop. There's a few imperfections that mark this as a tabletop quality piece but I was satisfied with how it turned out.
