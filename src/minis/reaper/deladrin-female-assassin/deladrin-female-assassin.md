I've shown Deladrin a while back in a previous post but never got around to posting the finished version. Only about four years later, no biggie right?

Deladrin was started to test out a few techniques - primarily two brush blending on her cloak. Once I had finished that she became a side piece that I worked on between other models. I think the oiled leather look on the armor turned out rather well, as did the hair. It was probably easier than normal for me since there was so little of it.
