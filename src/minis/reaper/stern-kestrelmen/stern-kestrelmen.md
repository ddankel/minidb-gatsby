This figure was chosen by the player of our "knight in shining armor" character in the rotating GM game to use on the tabletop, so I went with bright plate armor accentuated with a bright regal blue. The stock figure is armed with a sword but I swapped it out for a hammer from the Games Workshop Mordheim Mercenary Sprue at the player's request.

I thought about accenting his armor with a brass or gold color but the character really isn't one for embellishment. I also used Stern here to test the "Advanced Faces" painting guide in issue 23 of [No Quarter Magazine](http://privateerpress.com/no-quarter) as opposed to my normal layering method. The technique turned out ok for a first attempt but I need to experiment some more before I'm comfortable with it.
