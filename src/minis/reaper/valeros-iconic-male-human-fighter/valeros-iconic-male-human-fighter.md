## Blog Post

Although it's a very dynamic pose, I wasn't as much of a fan of Valeros after assembly as I thought I would be. I picked it - like many of my miniatures - up to use as a character in an RPG. Even games where we don't use miniatures I tend to do go out and get one that matches a character or too. It's just one of my more consistent ways I find inspiration for what to paint.

I'm pretty happy with how Valeros turned out. I think the face wound up good and his tabard/undershirt are solid. I wish I had cleaned up the boot wraps and straps a bit better. The metalic fasteners don't really pop like they should.
