This miniature was inspired by a version painted by Jen Haley - her paint job was the only reason I picked this mini up. Rictur was probably the first mini I felt I did a decent job on, though hers is far better. This miniatures flesh was done in craft paints way back before I started using Vallejos. The cloak shading is a little deeper in person, but for one of my earlier minis, I was very happy with the smoothness of it.

The NMM was one of my earlier attempts, and mostly unsuccessful. It's an art that's still alluded me to this day. The punch dagger and armor studs are small enough that they turned out ok but the blade's large surfaces don't maintain the illusion.
