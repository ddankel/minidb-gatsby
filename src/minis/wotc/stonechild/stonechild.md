This miniature is a Chainmail miniature - WotC's metal predecessor to D&D Miniatures. The line as a whole contained mostly two-dimensional sculpts with no depth, but the Stonechild makes an excellent obsidiman for Earthdawn. It's even scaled a bit taller than most 25mm figures which is perfect, but it's also nearly impossible to find at this point.

This miniature's "flesh" was painted using the granite technique from [Hot-Lead](http://hot-lead.org/advance/texturing_granite.htm) web site, which uses an old toothbrush to "speckle" the grey undercoat. Everything else is rather unremarkable. I wish I would have highlighted the stone undercoat before I did the speckling - I think it could be more defined.
