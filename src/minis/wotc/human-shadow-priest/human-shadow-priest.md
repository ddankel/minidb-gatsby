## Blog Post

I worked on the Shadow Priest, another figure from the old D&D Chainmail line, on and off for a while as a side project. It was originally meant to carry a shield, but I gave the shield to the a Death Cleric I painted from the same line as part of a weapon swap conversion.

The scepter was an opportunity to test out painting gems, which I don't do too often. The armor was mostly dry brushing for the grungy gritty texture that technique can produce. I wanted a color reminiscent of a funeral shroud for the skirt so used tome P3 Cryx Bane Base color as the primary color there. In retrospect I should have gone brighter.
