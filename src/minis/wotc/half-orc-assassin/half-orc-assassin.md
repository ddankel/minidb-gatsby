This old Wizards of the Coast miniature is a relatively simple sculpt but he's got some nice character. The sculpt of the face in particular was fun to paint and took the darker skin tone I wanted to use on this miniature perfectly.

Painted up to use as an ork in Earthdawn, I went with darker and muted colors to go with his thuggish clothing. He's since been adopted by a player for his thief character.
