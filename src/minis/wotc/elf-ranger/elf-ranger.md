I picked up this ranger years after my first two attempts at painting WotC wood elf sculpts back in 2001 with the intent of doing a comparison piece. The brown leather color scheme wasn't anything extraordinary but that wasn't the point - the point was to create a spiritual successor to the Chainmail wood elves using what I'd learned over the years.

Immediate standouts for me are the face and the arrows. I used a basic wash technique on the face but it still came out far better than the originals. Then again, the originals were done with craft paint back when I was using that exclusively so that's no surprise.

The green arrow fletching look far better than what I did on the original wood elves. I'm still trying to master highlight placement in some ways but I can look back at the originals and see the dark to light gradient was basically non-existent.

I painted the mail and leather somewhat hastily on this piece, but it just looks cleaner. I do more blending than I do drybrushing nowadays but drybrushing has its place, and as seen here it can make a solid and effective tabletop piece.
