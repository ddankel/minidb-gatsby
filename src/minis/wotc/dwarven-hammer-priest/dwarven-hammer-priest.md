This is another of Chainmail's two-dimensional sculpts - the Hammer Priest was a member of the Mordenguard faction. I picked this one up cheap from the local shop after the game went under since I didn't have many dwarves to use in rpgs. Eventually a player requested it for their character, so it made its way to my painting area.

The Hammer Priest is a pretty plain miniature all things considered. The fact that I did all of the metallic armor in pretty much the same color didn't help that. The robe/tabard was done in purple for the nethermancer-ish feel the player wanted.
