Back when Wizards of the Coast was releasing Chainmail, the metal unpainted non-collectable precursor to D&D Miniatures, their price point was low enough that I picked up a few figures to use in RPGs and the like. Back then I had just started painting and I was using the Wood Elves (this one and the Ranger) to work on some basic painting techniques. The Scout didn't turn out nearly as well as the ranger did.

I was still heavy into drybrushing at the time and all the highlights on the leather and the greens are chalky as a result. I was rather pleased with how the bow took the drybrushing but the highlights turned out rather subtle.

The Scout here isn't up to my current standard but it's good sometimes to look a back at where you started.
